# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Mobile Edge Computing

This is a repository containing Python code and a corresponding article on the topic of mobile edge computing (MEC) and its optimization using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques. The article discusses the challenges of designing an efficient task-offloading strategy for the whole MEC system, and proposes the use of multi-agent DRL to support smart task offloading in a MEC network.

Specifically, the project simplifies the MEC problem as video task processing and applies three different DRL methods based on Actor-Critic structure: Multi-Agent Advantage Actor-Critic (MAA2C), Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO), and Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG). The reward function for different environment parameters is compared, as well as the final results.

## Motivation

Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a promising technology that can improve the computing experience of electronic devices by offloading computation-based tasks to MEC servers located near the cloud servers. However, designing an efficient task-offloading strategy for the whole MEC system is not easy. Recently, many edge task offloading schemes have been proposed, but most of them consider single-agent offloading scenarios using traditional convex optimization tools. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques, such as deep Q-learning (DQN), have emerged as a promising alternative by modeling offloading problems as Markov decision processes (MDP) using deep neural networks (DNN) for function approximation. However, these efforts only use a single agent to handle the entire offloading process and do not work well in a large-scale distributed MEC environment. An interesting alternative is to use a multi-agent DRL (MA-DRL) to support smart task offloading in a MEC network.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can clone the repository and run the Python code on your machine. You will need to have Python 3 and the following packages installed:

- Tensorflow
- PyTorch
- Keras
- OpenAI Gym

You can install these packages using pip:

```python
pip install tensorflow keras gym torch
```

## Usage

The main code files in this repository are:

- `maa2c.py`: Implements the Multi-Agent Advantage Actor-Critic (MAA2C) algorithm.
- `mappo.py`: Implements the Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) algorithm.
- `maddpg.py`: Implements the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm.
- `env.py`: Defines the MEC environment and its reward function.
- `train.py`: Trains the agents using the specified DRL algorithm and environment parameters.
- `evaluate.py`: Evaluates the trained agents on the environment.

To train the agents, run `train.py` with the desired algorithm and environment parameters:

```
python train.py --algorithm maa2c --env-params env_params.json
```

To evaluate the trained agents, run `evaluate.py` with the same algorithm and environment parameters:

```
python evaluate.py --algorithm maa2c --env-params env_params.json
```
